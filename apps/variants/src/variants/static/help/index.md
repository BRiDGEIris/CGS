*IMPORTANT*: current code is for test purpose and it is far from perfect. If an error occurred, see the logs files AND debug.txt file (debug.txt is a personal file to manage exceptions)

##**Requirements**

Library to install for python: pycurl 
Data uploaded should be added to user/hdfs/data/. Subfolders are not taken into account yet.
Data compressed will be uploaded to user/hdfs/compressed_data/. 
Those folders should be manually created by the developer if they do not exist yet.

Change the privileges for the application does not work, do it for hue in general (dumb way to do it, but it works):
```
cd /usr/lib/
sudo find hue -type d -exec chmod 0777 {} \;
sudo find hue -type f -exec chmod 0777 {} \;
```

Database installation:
Launch hue, then go to http://quickstart.cloudera:8888/variants/database/initialize/


##**API**

###*Authentification:*
```
curl --data "username=cloudera&password=cloudera" -c "cookies.txt" -b "cookies.txt"
-X POST http://quickstart.cloudera:8888/accounts/login/
```

###*Request:*
 * Search for files containing the CUSTOMER_SAMPLE_ID and return {[customer_file_id, hdfs_file_path], ...}
    (note for the developers: the customer_sample_id in db is a little bit different than this one)
    ```    
    curl --data "sample_id=<CUSTOMER_SAMPLE_ID>" -c "cookies.txt" -b "cookies.txt" -X POST 
    http://quickstart.cloudera:8888/genomicAPI/api/files/search
	```

###*Resources*
Definition of the resources is largely inspired from Google Genomics (https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1beta2/reference) but may slightly differ.
The resource type has one or more data representations and one or more methods.
The resource representations are detailed in the subsection [Resource representation](#readgroupsets) and the methods are described in the subsection [Methods](#methods).

#### <a name="resourceRepresentations">Resource representations</a> 

Resource types are:

- Samples
- Datasets
- Readgroupsets
- Variantsets
- Variants
- Callsets

**Samples**
Multiple samples can come from the same patient. The sample ID is also given in the read group set.  

| Property name | Value         | Description                              |
| -------       | ------------- | -----------                              |
| id            | string        | sample id                                |

| datasetId     | string        | dataset id                               |


**Datasets**

A dataset is a collection of genomic data. It can contain many read group sets, variant sets, and call sets.

| Property name | Value         | Description |
| -------       | ------------- | ----------- |
| id            | string        | CGS id      |


**Readgroupsets**

A read group set is a logical collection of read groups, which are collections of reads produced by a sequencer. A read group set typically models reads corresponding to one sample, sequenced one way, and aligned one way. A read group set belongs to a dataset. A read group belongs to one read group set.

**Variants**
A variant represents a change in DNA sequence relative to a reference sequence. For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion. Variants belong to a variant set. Each of the calls on a variant represent a determination of genotype with respect to that variant. For example, a call might assign probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a sample named NA12345. A call belongs to a call set, which contains related calls typically from one sample.
