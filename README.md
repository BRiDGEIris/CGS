# cgs-apps
Genomics API for accessing data, importing data, visualizing data, etc.

This package is part of the [**CGS**](https://github.com/jpoullet2000/cgs) project. In reality, it is more than just APIs: this module also contains user interfaces that are available through the web interface [Hue](http://gethue.com/). 

This API is written in Python/Django and web services are made available as plugins in Hue (which is therefore required). One may choose between the available Hue apps we provide.   

A description of the API and the apps available in Hue are described below.
