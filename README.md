# The **CGS** project
The **CGS** project stands for Centralized genomics system. The goal of this project is to offer a big data infrastructure for genomics data, and in particular for variant information.

This project has been initiated within the BridgeIris project funded by [Innoviris](http://www.innoviris.be).
